== FREEBAYES ==

Overview:

FreeBayes is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find small
polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms) and indels
(insertions and deletions) smaller than the length of a short-read sequencing
alignment.  It uses short-read alignments (BAM files) for any number of
individuals from a population and a reference genome to determine the
most-likely combination of genotypes for the population at each position in a
reference genome (FASTA).  It reports positions which it finds to be more
likely polymorphic than monomorphic in a standard variant interchange format
(VCF).


Compilation:

FreeBayes requires g++ and the standard C and C++ development libraries.

    % make && sudo make install

Will build and install the executable freebayes to /usr/local/bin.


Usage:

In its simplest operation, it requires only two inputs: a FASTA reference
sequence, and a BAM-format alignment file sorted by reference position.  For instance:

    % freebayes --fasta-reference h.sapiens.fasta NA20504.bam

Will produce a VCF (Variant Call Format [1]) file on standard out describing
all SNPs between the reference and the alignments in NA20504.bam.  In order to
produce correct output, the reference supplied must be the reference to which
NA20504.bam was aligned.

Users may specify any number of BAM files on the command line.  FreeBayes uses
the BamTools API [2] to open and parse these files in parallel.

For a more detailed description of available command-line options, run:

    % freebayes --help
